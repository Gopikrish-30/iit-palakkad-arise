# Security Guide for IIT Palakkad Website

## Current Security Status - UPGRADED TO ENTERPRISE LEVEL

### ✅ What's Protected Now (ENHANCED)
- **Admin Interface**: Secure session-based authentication with rate limiting
- **Media Upload API**: Protected with session validation and CSRF protection
- **Session Management**: Enterprise-grade secure session tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: IP-based login attempt limiting with lockout
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **CSRF Protection**: Origin and referer validation

### ⚠️ What's Still Public
- **Uploaded Media Files**: Files in `/uploads/` are publicly accessible (by design)
- **Website Content**: All public pages are accessible to everyone (by design)
- **Media URLs**: Anyone with the direct URL can view uploaded files (by design)

## Security Levels Explained

### ✅ Level 3: Enterprise Security (CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION)
```
✅ Session-based authentication with secure tokens
✅ Rate limiting for login attempts (5 attempts max)
✅ IP-based account lockout (15 minutes)
✅ CSRF protection with origin validation
✅ Secure HTTP-only cookies
✅ Comprehensive audit logging
✅ Time-constant password comparison
✅ Secure session management
✅ Protected API routes
✅ Environment-based configuration
```

## Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Session-based Authentication**: Uses secure 32-byte random tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 5 failed login attempts per IP address
- **Account Lockout**: 15-minute lockout after exceeding failed attempts
- **Secure Cookies**: HTTP-only, secure, SameSite strict cookies
- **CSRF Protection**: Validates request origin and referer headers
- **Time-constant Comparison**: Prevents timing attacks on password verification

### Session Management
- **Secure Token Generation**: Uses Node.js crypto.randomBytes()
- **Session Expiration**: 24-hour session timeout with automatic cleanup
- **Session Invalidation**: Proper logout with immediate session destruction
- **Session Validation**: Real-time session verification on each request

### Security Monitoring & Logging
- **Audit Logging**: All security events logged with timestamps and IP addresses
- **Failed Login Tracking**: IP-based tracking with automatic lockout
- **Unauthorized Access Logging**: Logs attempts to access protected resources
- **Security Event Types**:
  - `SUCCESSFUL_LOGIN` - Successful admin login
  - `FAILED_LOGIN` - Failed login attempt
  - `LOGOUT` - User logout
  - `RATE_LIMITED_LOGIN` - Login blocked due to rate limiting
  - `UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS_ATTEMPT` - Attempt to access admin without session
  - `UNAUTHORIZED_API_ACCESS` - Attempt to access protected API without session
  - `CSRF_ATTEMPT` - Request blocked due to invalid origin

## Quick Setup Instructions

### 1. Set Admin Password
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:
```bash
ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123!
```

### 2. Access Admin Panel
1. Go to `yourdomain.com/admin`
2. You'll be redirected to login page
3. Enter your password
4. Access granted for 24 hours

### 3. Upload Media
1. Login to admin panel
2. Go to Media tab
3. Upload your files
4. Copy URLs to use in other sections

## Media File Visibility Options

### Option A: Keep Files Public (Current)
**Pros:**
- Simple setup
- Fast loading
- Works with CDNs
- No server processing needed

**Cons:**
- Anyone can access files with direct URLs
- No access control
- Files visible to search engines

**Use Case:** Public website content, logos, public images

### Option B: Protect Media Files
If you want to protect uploaded files, here's how:

1. **Move uploads outside public directory**
2. **Create protected file serving API**
3. **Add authentication checks**

Would you like me to implement protected file serving?

## Hosting Considerations

### Public Hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
```bash
# Your files will be accessible at:
https://yoursite.com/uploads/images/photo.jpg

# Anyone in the world can access this URL
```

### Private Hosting Options
1. **Password-protect entire site**
2. **Use private repositories**
3. **Implement user authentication**
4. **Use cloud storage with access controls**

## Recommended Security Measures

### For Public Websites
1. ✅ Keep current setup
2. ✅ Use strong admin password
3. ✅ Regular backups
4. ✅ Monitor access logs
5. ✅ Update dependencies

### For Private/Internal Websites
1. ✅ Implement protected file serving
2. ✅ Add user authentication
3. ✅ Use HTTPS only
4. ✅ Implement rate limiting
5. ✅ Add audit logging

## Implementation Examples

### Protect Specific File Types
```typescript
// Only protect sensitive documents
if (request.nextUrl.pathname.includes('/uploads/documents/')) {
  // Require authentication
}
// Keep images public
```

### Role-Based Access
```typescript
// Different access levels
const userRole = getUserRole(request)
if (userRole === 'admin') {
  // Full access
} else if (userRole === 'editor') {
  // Limited access
} else {
  // Public access only
}
```

## Quick Security Checklist

### Before Going Live
- [ ] Set strong admin password in `.env.local`
- [ ] Test admin login functionality
- [ ] Verify file upload works
- [ ] Check media URLs are accessible
- [ ] Test logout functionality
- [ ] Review what should be public vs private

### After Going Live
- [ ] Monitor admin access logs
- [ ] Regular password updates
- [ ] Backup uploaded files
- [ ] Monitor file storage usage
- [ ] Review and clean unused files

## FAQ

### Q: Will my uploaded photos be visible to everyone?
**A:** Yes, currently uploaded files are publicly accessible if someone knows the URL. The admin interface is protected, but the files themselves are public.

### Q: How do I make files private?
**A:** You would need to implement protected file serving (I can help with this). Files would be moved outside the public directory and served through an authenticated API.

### Q: Is this secure enough for a university website?
**A:** For public content (research photos, publications, etc.), yes. For sensitive documents, consider implementing protected file serving.

### Q: Can I password-protect the entire website?
**A:** Yes, you can add authentication to all routes, not just admin. This would make the entire site private.

### Q: What happens if someone guesses my file URLs?
**A:** They can access the files directly. Use protected file serving if this is a concern.
