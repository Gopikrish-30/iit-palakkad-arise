# Media Storage Implementation Notes

## Current Implementation

The media storage system has been designed to work in both development and production environments:

### Development Environment
- Files are saved to the local file system in `public/uploads/`
- Media metadata is stored in `public/uploads/media-data.json`
- Files are accessible via direct URLs like `/uploads/images/filename.jpg`

### Production Environment (Vercel)
- Files are stored as base64 data URLs (temporary solution)
- Media metadata is stored in memory (resets on each deployment)
- This is a **temporary solution** for demonstration purposes

## Recommended Production Solutions

For a production deployment, you should implement one of these cloud storage solutions:

### 1. Cloudinary (Recommended)
```bash
npm install cloudinary
```
- Free tier: 25 GB storage, 25 GB bandwidth
- Automatic image optimization and transformations
- CDN delivery
- Easy integration

### 2. AWS S3
```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3
```
- Pay-as-you-use pricing
- Highly scalable
- Requires AWS account setup

### 3. Vercel Blob Storage
```bash
npm install @vercel/blob
```
- Integrated with Vercel
- Simple API
- Pay-as-you-use

### 4. Supabase Storage
```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```
- Free tier: 1 GB storage
- PostgreSQL database included
- Real-time features

## Implementation Steps for Production

1. Choose a cloud storage provider
2. Update `lib/media-storage.ts` to use the cloud API
3. Update environment variables with API keys
4. Test upload/delete functionality
5. Update the MediaPicker component if needed

## Current Limitations

- **File Size**: Data URLs can become very large and slow
- **Persistence**: In-memory storage resets on each deployment
- **Performance**: Base64 encoding increases file size by ~33%

## Files to Update for Cloud Storage

1. `lib/media-storage.ts` - Main storage logic
2. `app/api/media/upload/route.ts` - Upload endpoint
3. `app/api/media/[id]/route.ts` - Delete endpoint
4. Environment variables for API keys

## Testing

The current implementation works for:
- ✅ File upload (with data URLs in production)
- ✅ File preview and display
- ✅ File deletion
- ✅ Media picker component
- ✅ Authentication protection

Note: For production use, implement proper cloud storage as described above.
